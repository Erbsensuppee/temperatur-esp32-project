# ESP32 Project with bme280
I try to create a project with ESP-IDF and I will only use VIM ad my IDF.

## How to create a project with idf.py
1. Create a Project
    ```idf.py create-project YOUR_PROJECT_NAME```
2. set the target - Do this in the file with CMakeLists.txt 
    ```idf.py set-target YOUR_ESP32```
